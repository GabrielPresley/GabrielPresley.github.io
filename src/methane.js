      <p>Air Polution Monitor</p>\
\
     <p class=\'hidden popUpdesc\'> METHANE -- Air pollution is a dire health and environmental threat at the forefront of humanity\'s concerns. As a result, there have been many studies focused on developing different environmental monitoring methods. Floating air monitors and towers that are currently being employed are efficient for data collection but are difficult to move to new places and air monitoring drones, although effective, can be quite expensive and are limited by their battery life. Theoretically, one can create a more effective drone for environmental monitoring by using a symmetrical fixed wing design.\
